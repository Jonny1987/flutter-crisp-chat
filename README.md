## Installation

First, add `flutter_crisp_chat` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/using-packages/).

To use the Flutter Crisp Chat, simply import the `flutter_crisp_chat` package:

Run this on your project terminal:

```yaml
flutter pub add flutter_crisp_chat
```

or manually configure pubspec.yml fi

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_crisp_chat: ^0.0.1
```

### iOS

Add two rows to the `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

* key `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` and a usage description.
* key `Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description` and a usage description.
* key `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` and a usage description.

If editing `Info.plist` as text, add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>your usage description here</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>your usage description here</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>your usage description here</string>
```

### Android

Add Internet permission on `AndroidManifest.xml` in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```groovy
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```


Change the minimum Compile SDK version to 33 (or higher) in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

```groovy
compileSdkVersion 33
```

Change the minimum Android SDK version to 21 (or higher) in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.


```groovy
minSdkVersion 21
```


## Usage
To check if the app has been used for at least 15 days and opened at least 10 times, use the `openCrispChat` method of the `FlutterCrispChat` class. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the app has been used enough:

##### First Imported Package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_crisp_chat/crisp_chat.dart';
```

##### Then:

```dart
 final String websiteID = 'YOUR_WEBSITE_KEY';

 final _flutterCrispChatPlugin = FlutterCrispChat();
```


 ```dart 
 @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Crisp Chat'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              await _flutterCrispChatPlugin.openCrispChat(
                websiteID: websiteID,
              );
            },
            child: const Text('Open Crisp Chat'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  } 
  ```

This is a simple Flutter app that demonstrates how to use the `FlutterCrispChat` plugin to open a chat window using the Crisp chat service. The app has a single button that, when pressed, will launch the chat window.

The main function runs the app, which consists of a single MyApp widget. This widget is stateful and creates an instance of the `FlutterCrispChat` plugin.

The build function creates a MaterialApp with a Scaffold that contains an AppBar and an `ElevatedButton`. The button's onPressed method calls the `openCrispChat` method of the `FlutterCrispChat` plugin with the website ID passed as a parameter.

To use this code, you will need to provide your own Crisp website ID. You can do this by replacing `YOUR_WEBSITE_KEY` with your own website ID. Once you have done this, you can run the app and press the `"Open Crisp Chat"` button to launch the chat window.
